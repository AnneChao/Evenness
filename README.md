# Evenness
The data used in the code and in the paper (as a worked example) were collected by Caccianiga et al. (2006) and analyzed in Ricotta et al. (2016, 2018); see Chao and Ricotta (2019, Ecology) for details.

"Evenness" includes four files:
(1) Alpine data: the relative abundances of 45 Alpine species for three successional stages; see Figure 1.
(2) Alpine phylo_tree: phylogenetic tree of 45 Alpine species; see Figure 1. 
(3) Evenness.R: Main code for computing the profiles of six classess of evenness measures (listed in Table 1 with plots in Figure 2) and for computing the contribution of each species/node to Jaccard-type taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity measures (see Figures 3 and 4). The corresponding contribution to Sorensen-type taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity measures are shown in Appendix S3.
(4) Lorenz.R: R code for computing and plotting the Lorenz curves of assemblages; see Appendix S4 for examples.
