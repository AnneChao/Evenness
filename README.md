# Evenness
The data used in the code were collected by Caccianiga et al. (2006) and analyzed in Ricotta et al. (2016, 2018); see Chao and Ricotta's evenness paper for details.

The code includes four files:
(1) Alpine data: relative abundances of 45 Alpine species
(2) Alpine phylo_tree: phylogenetic tree of 45 Alpine species 
(3) Evenness.R: Main code for computing the profiles of six classess of evenness measures and species/node contribution to Jaccard- and         Sorensen-type dissimilarity measures
(4) Lorenz.R: R code for computing and plotting Lorenz curves of assemblages

More details will be given when Chao and Ricotta's evenness paper is accepted for publication.
