# Evenness
The data used in the code and in the paper (as a worked example) were collected by Caccianiga et al. (2006) and analyzed in Ricotta et al. (2016, 2018); see Chao and Ricotta's evenness paper for details.

"Evenness" includes four files:
(1) Alpine data: the relative abundances of 45 Alpine species for three successional stages.
(2) Alpine phylo_tree: phylogenetic tree of 45 Alpine species. 
(3) Evenness.R: Main code for computing the profiles of six classess of evenness measures (listed in Table 1) and for computing the contribution of each species/node to taxonomic or phylogenetic Jaccard- and Sorensen-type dissimilarity measures.
(4) Lorenz.R: R code for computing and plotting Lorenz curves of assemblages.
